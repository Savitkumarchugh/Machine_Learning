    "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that aims to build a hierarchy of clusters. Unlike other clustering techniques, hierarchical clustering does not require the pre-specification of the number of clusters. Instead, it organizes the data into a tree-like structure, also known as a dendrogram, based on the similarity between data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between hierarchical clustering and other clustering techniques, such as K-means or DBSCAN, is that hierarchical clustering creates a nested structure of clusters, allowing for a more detailed exploration of the data's clustering patterns. It provides a visual representation of how individual data points or clusters merge together to form larger clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering can be categorized into two types: agglomerative (bottom-up) and divisive (top-down) clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point as a separate cluster and iteratively merges the closest pairs of clusters based on a similarity metric, such as Euclidean distance or linkage methods like complete, single, or average linkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Divisive clustering, on the other hand, starts with all data points in a single cluster and recursively splits the clusters into smaller clusters until each data point is in its own cluster. Divisive clustering is less commonly used than agglomerative clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering offers advantages such as flexibility in exploring different levels of granularity, the ability to handle different types of data (e.g., numerical, categorical), and the absence of a need to specify the number of clusters in advance. However, it can be computationally expensive for large datasets and is sensitive to noise and outliers.\n",
