    "1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, decision making, and perception. AI systems can use a range of techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics, to simulate human intelligence and perform tasks that would otherwise require human intervention.\n",

    "2. Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that focuses on enabling computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. In ML, algorithms are trained on large datasets and use statistical techniques to automatically improve their performance on a specific task, such as image recognition or natural language processing. For example, an ML algorithm can be trained on a dataset of images of cats and dogs to accurately classify new images as either a cat or a dog.\n",

    "3. Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns from large datasets. It involves training neural networks on large amounts of data to recognize and classify objects or patterns in the data. Deep learning has achieved breakthroughs in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. For example, deep learning can be used to identify objects in images or to recognize speech in audio recordings."

    "* Supervised learning: In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset where the input data and their corresponding output values are known. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new input data. For example, in a classification problem where the goal is to predict whether an email is spam or not, the dataset will include emails that are labeled as either spam or not spam. The model is trained on this dataset to learn the patterns that distinguish spam emails from non-spam emails.\n",

The model is trained on this dataset to identify groups of items that are similar to each other.\n",

In semi-supervised learning, the model is trained on a dataset that includes both labeled and unlabeled data.

For example, in a classification problem, the dataset may include a small number of labeled data points and a large number of unlabeled data points. The model is trained on the labeled data to learn the patterns that distinguish the different classes, and then this knowledge is used to make predictions on the unlabeled data.\n",
